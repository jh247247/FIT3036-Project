** Discussion
   What kind of system grows without bound? I.e: has positive
   feedback?
   - Wildfire
   - Corruption in government
   - Population without predators
   - Greenhouse effect
** Work
   Come up with at least 3 ideas that can change the global
   environment drastically that we can implement in daisy world.
   - Meteor strike
   - Volcano
   - Fire
   - Greenhouse effect
** Independent ideas
   - Daisy predators?
     - Goes against the whole idea of planet only occupied by daisies
   - "Harvesters"
     - Where daisies are harvested from a certain area, periodically
       killing them off
   - Different maximum age for different daisies
     - I.e: black lives longer than white?
   - Different growth rates at different temperatures?
     - Attempt to knock the balance off-kilter
     - White prefers high temps and black low temps (Might actually
       cause oscillation, would be interesting...)
     - White prefers low temps and black high temps, essentially
       positive feedback.
