** Discussion
   What kind of system grows without bound? I.e: has positive
   feedback?
   - Wildfire
   - Corruption in government
   - Population without predators
   - Greenhouse effect
** Work
   Come up with at least 3 ideas that can change the global
   environment drastically that we can implement in daisy world.
   - Meteor strike
   - Volcano
   - Fire
   - Greenhouse effect
** Independent ideas
   - Daisy predators?
     - Goes against the whole idea of planet only occupied by daisies
   - "Harvesters"
     - Where daisies are harvested from a certain area, periodically
       killing them off
   - Different maximum age for different daisies
     - I.e: black lives longer than white?
   - Different growth rates at different temperatures?
     - Attempt to knock the balance off-kilter
     - White prefers high temps and black low temps (Might actually
       cause oscillation, would be interesting...)
     - White prefers low temps and black high temps, essentially
       positive feedback.

** Draft abstract
   Points to make:
   - What:
     - What problem are we trying to solve?
     - What were the results of your research?
     - What are the implications of the research?
   - Why:
     - Why are we doing this?
   - How:
     - How are we going to do this?
     - How are we going to change it from previous research?

   Daisyworld is a computer simulation proposed by James Lovelock and
   Andrew Watson in a paper published in 1983. It proposes the
   possibility of a simple system that self regulates via the albedo
   of the two kinds of daisies that grow on an isolated planet. In
   an attempt to illustrate the effects of speciation(?), the computer
   simulation is modified by having the two types of daisies flourish
   at different temperatures. This modification induced (X) and
   showed (Y). Etc?
** Program design
   - World
     - Contains some topology of the entire planet, make it simple
       and be a grid/torus
     - Each tile contains either a type of daisy or bare earth
     - Manages the temperatures at each of the tiles using the
       incident radiation and the amount absorbed by the albedo at
       each tile
   - Tile
     - Contains a daisy or bare earth
     - Has a incident amount of light
     - Has an albedo, dependent on the object at this tile
     - Has a local temperature, local object is dependent on this
     - Does it need a number of time steps since the "object" has
       been living on it?
       - I.e: the daisy will be more likely to die dependent on the
	 difference between the ideal temp and the local temp as well
	 as the amount of time since it spawned
     - At each time step, this has to calculate the probability of
       certain events happening, e.g: the daisy dying or a new daisy
       spawning
       - Will we have multiple daisies in one tile?
   - Daisy
     - Can spawn, grow, die
     - Growth is dependent on the incident radiation and temperature
       (delta ideal temp)
     - Has an albedo (independent from the containing tile)
     - Has an ideal temperature (template programming or just an
       overloaded constructor?)
     - "Just a container" to be handled by the containing tile
     - Has an ideal spawn temperature, make this dependent on the
       type of daisy?
   - Sun
     - Has an output of radiation
     - Radiation can increase/decrease over time
     - Affects global temperature via amount of radiation
     - Controlled by user?
   - UI
     - Controlled by user
     - Should contain graphs of spawn probability vs temp for each
       type of daisy
     - Should show topology of the planet with graphics for daisies
     - Should have some kind of input for ideal daisy temp and
       incident radiation
     - Should have input for incident radiation vs time
     - Should communicate only with an eventbus(?) Callbacks
       complicate things a bit too much, makes my life easier.

** What makes a good title?
   - Be informative
   - Be catchy
   - Can't be too long
   - Keywords
     - Often are specified in the article
     - e.g: Daisyworld, homeostatic, climate
   - Have to be unabiguouos
   - Memorable!
   - Catchphrase; explains a lot in a few words
   - Impactful words, then a sentence explaining what it is about
** What makes a bad title?
   - Uses Jargon
   - Vague
   -
** Good titles?
   - Daisyworld; the tale of two flowers



** This week
   - Start coding classes
     - Idea for UI/graphics pyQT
   - Read "Individual based modelling and ecology" by Grimm
     - Remember to mention agent-based model in paper introduction
